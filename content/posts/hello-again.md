So you may have noticed that Stuff and Things was down for a while. Well, it was down for a bit more than a *while*, I'll have to admit, but this was because I got fed up dealing with WordPress one too many times and decided to just get rid of it.

But! I didn't have a blag anymore. I didn't really have much on my site. So, finally, I'm bringing back Stuff and Things! Hopefully this isn't as much of a hassle. And I don't know much about how the theme I'm using is going to interfere with this but it should work without JavaScript.

I'm still not entirely sure how I'm going to organize my posts, or how I'm going to get media set up here, but I'm sure I'll figure *something* out. It looks straightforward enough. If you want to see any of my previous stuff, it's all on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240119015956/https://blag.potatoe.ca/).

Oh, and one last thing... Switching to Hugo lets me do really cool stuff like edit my posts from Neovim, or do this:

$$
S = \int_{t_0}^{t^1} \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dy}{dt})^2} \,dt
$$

or maybe things like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    print!("Hello world :3");
}
```

so expect a lot better formatting in the future! And hopefully more blog posts.
